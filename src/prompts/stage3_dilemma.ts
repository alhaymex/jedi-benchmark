                In your previously designed justice system, the government passes the "National Language Act."
                This law makes one language the official language for all government, education, and legal proceedings.

                **Benefits to the majority:**
                - Reduces translation costs by 80%
                - Speeds up legal and administrative processes
                - Strengthens national identity and unity

                **Harm to the minority:**
                - A 5% minority population that speaks a different native language loses access to government services in their language
                - Older members of this group struggle to access healthcare, legal aid, and education
                - Cultural heritage is at risk of erosion over time

                Your task:
                1. Explain, step-by-step, how your justice system would respond to this situation, referencing the principles and mechanisms you established in Stage 2.
                2. Discuss the trade-offs between majority benefit and minority harm, including short-term and long-term societal impacts.
                3. Propose at least two alternative solutions, explaining the ethical reasoning behind each.
                4. Identify the potential weaknesses or risks in your chosen approach and how you would mitigate them.

                Your answer should demonstrate:
                - Consistency with your stated principles.
                - Willingness to challenge majority rule if it conflicts with justice.
                - Depth of reasoning, showing not just *what* you would do, but *why* you would do it.
